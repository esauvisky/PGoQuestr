>This is a work in progress, currently working but requires perodically watching the device in case it gets stuck. Also this is all the documentation there is. _If you're here you probably know what you're doing._

## How to use

1. Set up `config.yaml` to match your device's resolution.
2. Zoom all the way in, preferably with compass pointing north.
3. Set up a list of coordinates of pokestops with the same quest.

**BEWARE: Currently the only quest that this works with is "Spin X number of pokestops".**

_Following fixes of bugs and general structure, quests of type *"Trade X pokémons"* are the next in line._

Bye.

Oh, also:

4. Install all python libraries dependencies. And no.. I have not generated a requirements.txt yet.
